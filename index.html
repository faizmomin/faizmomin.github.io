        <p class="mainP">How much social media do you use? Have you thought
        about how much information you put on the internet about yourself? Do
        you know what cyber bullying is? If you don't, you are in the right
        place. Here you will find out what bullying is, the different types of
        bullying, the different people involved in it, tips on how you can
        prevent it, and much more. This website is for all kinds of bullying,
        especially cyber bullying.</p><strong></strong>

        <p id="bullyingTitle"><strong>Bullying</strong></p>

        <p id="bullying">Before you go anywhere, you need to know what bullying
        is. In the oxford dictionary, it says "Use superior strength or
        influence to intimidate (someone), typically to force them to do
        something". This pretty much means that somebody thinks that they are
        better that someone else and that they can do what they want to the
        person. The bully uses their power (this can be strength, popularity,
        etc) to force another person to do something else. Depending on how
        serious the problem is, the consequences can be fatal for the victim.
        Now that you know what bullying is, you can check out the rest of the
        website.</p><img align="right" height="100px" id="bullyingLogo" src=

            <p class="mainP" id="cyber">When people think of bullying, the
            first thing that goes into their mind is some person beating up
            someone smaller than them. However, there are many types of
            bullying that can happen to people. This webpage is specifically
            for cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is where you bully somebody
            through digital media online. This can be sending them mean, rude
            or threatening messages, make a fake profile of someone and make
            fun of them on it, etc.

            <strong><span class="mainPtitle">People Involved in Bullying
            Situations</span></strong>

            <p class="mainP" id="involve"><strong>Bully</strong> -someone
            responsible for bullying, a form of aggressive behavior manifested
            by the use of force or coercion to affect others.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Victim</strong> -someone who may have characteristics such
            as being physically weak as well as being easily distraught
            emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make
            them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having
            some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims
            of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied
            indirectly.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Bystander</strong> -A bystander is someone who sees or
            knows about bullying or other forms of violence that is happening
            to someone else; they can either be part of the problem (hurtful
            bystander) or part of the solution (helpful bystander). It's easy
            to ignore incidents of bullying, or walk away thinking "at least
            it’s not me".</p>

            <p class="mainP" id="quotes">"If you're horrible to me, I'm going
            to write a song about it, and you won't like it. That's how I
            operate."<br>
            - Taylor Swift<br>
            <br>
            "One's dignity may be assaulted, vandalized and cruelly mocked, but
            it can never be taken away unless it is surrendered."<br>
            - Michael J. Fox<br>
            <br>
            "I would rather be a little nobody, then to be a evil
            somebody."<br>
            - Abraham Lincoln<br>
            <br>

            right."<br>
            - Theodore Roosevelt<br>
            <br>
            "If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the
            side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a
            mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not
            appreciate your neutrality."<br>
